# yossh_test

## Prompt User 1 ##

Create a web app that allows user to input their expenses in a database

## Prompt User 2 ##

Show list of expenses that user inputed and showing 20% tax (which is included in the price inputed)

## Description ##
The web app is full stack, but it is mostly focused on the back end. The front end is minimal. I used the MEAN stack to accomplish the task. I used this stack because I am most comfterable with using the stack. If I had more time I would sharpen up the frontend, add more validations to the input, and add a log in and registration so that you can input the data with different users. 

## How to build ##
1. Install node and NPM on pc.
2. Locate the root folder of Yossh_test
3. type in npm install
4. type node server.js
